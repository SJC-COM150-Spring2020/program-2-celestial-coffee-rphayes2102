<h1>Program 2:  Celestial Coffee</h1>

<p>The purpose of  this exercise is to create a program takes in the user’s name and address and  coffee order and display the total order with the appropriate sales tax.</p>
<h3>In this exercise, you will:</h3>
<ul><li>Create an algorithm</li>
  <li>Work with adding Controls to a Visual Basic Form</li>
  <li>Declare and Assign values to Variables</li>
  <li>Use a Constant Variable</li>
  <li>Cast Inputs to appropriate data types</li>
  <li>Use arithmetic operations</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ol><li>Before  your Code:&nbsp; Create the algorithm
  <ul><li>Identify  inputs (Name, Address, City, State, Zip, Pounds of regular coffee ordered,  Pounds of Decaf coffee ordered) </li>
    <li>Identify  the steps in your process </li>
    <li>Identify  outputs (Name, Address, Total Pounds of Coffee & Total Price) </li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Create a new Visual Basic Windows Forms  Application named ‘CelestialCoffee’ and save it to your i:drive</li>
  <li>Design  your form by adding the necessary controls.&nbsp;  Play with the control properties to change colors/backgrounds.</li>
  <li>Write the code to calculate the total  pounds of coffee ordered and the total price plus sales tax.</li>
  <li>Output the user’s information and order  to the form. </li>
  <li>For an added challenge – spruce up your  form by adding a picture box with a relevant image </li>
